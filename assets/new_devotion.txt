{paragraph}FIRST READING
{paragraph}A reading from the Acts of the Apostles 1:12-14
{paragraph}“All with one accord devoted themselves to prayer.”
{paragraph}
{paragraph}[After Jesus was taken up into heaven,] the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away; and when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

{paragraph}V/ The word of the Lord.
{paragraph}R/ Thanks be to God.

{paragraph}RESONSORIAL PSALM
{paragraph}Psalm 27:.4.7-8a (R. 13)
{paragraph}R.I believe I shall see the Lord's goodness in the land of the living.
{paragraph}Or: Alleluia.
{paragraph}
{paragraph}1. The LORD is my light and my salvation; / whom shall I fear?
{paragraph}The LORD is the stronghold of my life; / whom should I dread? R.
{paragraph}
{paragraph}2. to live in the house of the LORD/ all the days of my life,
to gaze on the beauty of LORD to inquire at his temple. R
{paragraph}
{paragraph}3. O LORD, hear my voice when I call have mercy and answer me.
{paragraph}Of you my heart has spoken/ "Seek his face." RSECOND READINGA reading from the first Letter of Saint Peter	4:13-16"If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed. "
{paragraph}Beloved: Rejoice in so far as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a wrong-doer, or a mischief¬maker; yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God.
{paragraph}
{paragraph}V/ The word of the Lord.
{paragraph}R/ Thanks be to God.
{paragraph}
{paragraph}ALLELU1A	Cf. John 14:18
{paragraph}Alleluia. I will not leave you orphans, says the Lord; I will come back to you, and your hearts will rejoice. Alleluia.
{paragraph}
{paragraph}GOSPEL
{paragraph}"Father, glorify your Son. "
{paragraph}At that time: Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him power over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work which you gave me to do; and now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made. I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world; yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you; for I have given them the words which you gave me, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you did send me. I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours; all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you.

{paragraph}
{paragraph}<meditation_of_the_day>John 17:1-11
{paragraph}
{paragraph}On the eve of his death, Jesus prayed for all who would believe in him through the apostles' message . He had us in mind, and of all the things he could have asked the Father to give us-steadfast faith, hope, love, power, courage-he prayed that we would have the same unity among ourselves that characterizes the life of the Trinity. Jesus' highest desire for us is that we would be one, as he and his Father are one.
{paragraph}When we live in the unity that Jesus intends for us, we know God's love, fellowship with him, and the power of his name. Jesus' purpose is broader than that, however. He calls us to communicate this unity to the world. He wants us to share with all men and women the good news that the intimate, loving relationship that he enjoys with the Father is possible for them, too. When we are united, the presence of Jesus-all the power of his name and the love of God will be found in us.
{paragraph}This is the mission of the church, to share the gospel with all people. The Lord God, who is one, is himself the life that Jesus wants all men and women to have. As those called to bring that message to others, we must reflect the life and the unity that come from God alone.
{paragraph}Such unity, however, cannot be counterfeited by even our best efforts. The only way to achieve it is to look to Jesus' life and follow the way he established for us. The unity he had with the Father radiated throughout his life in his obedience to and reliance on God. To experience this kind of unity, we must open our hearts to Jesus and receive the blessings of unity, which is God's love for others manifested in lives transformed by the Spirit. Let us examine our relationships and repent for the ways we allow, and even encourage, disunity in our families, communities, parishes, and places of work. Let us ask the Holy Spirit to show us where we are intolerant of others because of their race, religion, economic status, or even their appearance, dress or way of speaking. As we ask forgiveness, God himself will build up his church through our witness; his work will be furthered by our unity.

I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world; yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.

{paragraph}
{paragraph}<meditation_of_the_day>John 17:1-11
{paragraph}
{paragraph}On the eve of his death, Jesus prayed for all who would believe in him through the apostles' message . He had us in mind, and of all the things he could have asked the Father to give us-steadfast faith, hope, love, power, courage-he prayed that we would have the same unity among ourselves that characterizes the life of the Trinity. Jesus' highest desire for us is that we would be one, as he and his Father are one.
{paragraph}When we live in the unity that Jesus intends for us, we know God's love, fellowship with him, and the power of his name. Jesus' purpose is broader than that, however. He calls us to communicate this unity to the world. He wants us to share with all men and women the good news that the intimate, loving relationship that he enjoys with the Father is possible for them, too. When we are united, the presence of Jesus-all the power of his name and the love of God will be found in us.
{paragraph}This is the mission of the church, to share the gospel with all people. The Lord God, who is one, is himself the life that Jesus wants all men and women to have. As those called to bring that message to others, we must reflect the life and the unity that come from God alone.
{paragraph}Such unity, however, cannot be counterfeited by even our best efforts. The only way to achieve it is to look to Jesus' life and follow the way he established for us. The unity he had with the Father radiated throughout his life in his obedience to and reliance on God. To experience this kind of unity, we must open our hearts to Jesus and receive the blessings of unity, which is God's love for others manifested in lives transformed by the Spirit. Let us examine our relationships and repent for the ways we allow, and even encourage, disunity in our families, communities, parishes, and places of work. Let us ask the Holy Spirit to show us where we are intolerant of others because of their race, religion, economic status, or even their appearance, dress or way of speaking. As we ask forgiveness, God himself will build up his church through our witness; his work will be furthered by our unity.

{paragraph}<meditation_of_the_day>John 17:1-11
{paragraph}
{paragraph}On the eve of his death, Jesus prayed for all who would believe in him through the apostles' message . He had us in mind, and of all the things he could have asked the Father to give us-steadfast faith, hope, love, power, courage-he prayed that we would have the same unity among ourselves that characterizes the life of the Trinity. Jesus' highest desire for us is that we would be one, as he and his Father are one.
{paragraph}When we live in the unity that Jesus intends for us, we know God's love, fellowship with him, and the power of his name. Jesus' purpose is broader than that, however. He calls us to communicate this unity to the world. He wants us to share with all men and women the good news that the intimate, loving relationship that he enjoys with the Father is possible for them, too. When we are united, the presence of Jesus-all the power of his name and the love of God will be found in us.
{paragraph}This is the mission of the church, to share the gospel with all people. The Lord God, who is one, is himself the life that Jesus wants all men and women to have. As those called to bring that message to others, we must reflect the life and the unity that come from God alone.
{paragraph}Such unity, however, cannot be counterfeited by even our best efforts. The only way to achieve it is to look to Jesus' life and follow the way he established for us. The unity he had with the Father radiated throughout his life in his obedience to and reliance on God. To experience this kind of unity, we must open our hearts to Jesus and receive the blessings of unity, which is God's love for others manifested in lives transformed by the Spirit. Let us examine our relationships and repent for the ways we allow, and even encourage, disunity in our families, communities, parishes, and places of work. Let us ask the Holy Spirit to show us where we are intolerant of others because of their race, religion, economic status, or even their appearance, dress or way of speaking. As we ask forgiveness, God himself will build up his church through our witness; his work will be furthered by our unity.

{paragraph}“All with one accord devoted themselves to prayer.”
{paragraph}
{paragraph}[After Jesus was taken up into heaven,] the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away; and when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

{paragraph}Beloved: Rejoice in so far as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a wrong-doer, or a mischief¬maker; yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God.

{paragraph}"Father, glorify your Son. "
{paragraph}At that time: Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him power over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work which you gave me to do; and now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made. I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world; yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you; for I have given them the words which you gave me, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you did send me. I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours; all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.

{paragraph}<meditation_of_the_day>John 17:1-11
{paragraph}
{paragraph}On the eve of his death, Jesus prayed for all who would believe in him through the apostles' message . He had us in mind, and of all the things he could have asked the Father to give us-steadfast faith, hope, love, power, courage-he prayed that we would have the same unity among ourselves that characterizes the life of the Trinity. Jesus' highest desire for us is that we would be one, as he and his Father are one.
{paragraph}When we live in the unity that Jesus intends for us, we know God's love, fellowship with him, and the power of his name. Jesus' purpose is broader than that, however. He calls us to communicate this unity to the world. He wants us to share with all men and women the good news that the intimate, loving relationship that he enjoys with the Father is possible for them, too. When we are united, the presence of Jesus-all the power of his name and the love of God will be found in us.
{paragraph}This is the mission of the church, to share the gospel with all people. The Lord God, who is one, is himself the life that Jesus wants all men and women to have. As those called to bring that message to others, we must reflect the life and the unity that come from God alone.
{paragraph}Such unity, however, cannot be counterfeited by even our best efforts. The only way to achieve it is to look to Jesus' life and follow the way he established for us. The unity he had with the Father radiated throughout his life in his obedience to and reliance on God. To experience this kind of unity, we must open our hearts to Jesus and receive the blessings of unity, which is God's love for others manifested in lives transformed by the Spirit. Let us examine our relationships and repent for the ways we allow, and even encourage, disunity in our families, communities, parishes, and places of work. Let us ask the Holy Spirit to show us where we are intolerant of others because of their race, religion, economic status, or even their appearance, dress or way of speaking. As we ask forgiveness, God himself will build up his church through our witness; his work will be furthered by our unity.

{paragraph}A reading from the Acts of the Apostles 1:12-14
{paragraph}“All with one accord devoted themselves to prayer.”
{paragraph}
{paragraph}[After Jesus was taken up into heaven,] the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away; and when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

{paragraph}Beloved: Rejoice in so far as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a wrong-doer, or a mischief¬maker; yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God.

{paragraph}"Father, glorify your Son. "
{paragraph}At that time: Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him power over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work which you gave me to do; and now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made. I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world; yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you; for I have given them the words which you gave me, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you did send me. I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours; all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you.

{paragraph}
{paragraph}<meditation_of_the_day>John 17:1-11
{paragraph}
{paragraph}On the eve of his death, Jesus prayed for all who would believe in him through the apostles' message . He had us in mind, and of all the things he could have asked the Father to give us-steadfast faith, hope, love, power, courage-he prayed that we would have the same unity among ourselves that characterizes the life of the Trinity. Jesus' highest desire for us is that we would be one, as he and his Father are one.
{paragraph}When we live in the unity that Jesus intends for us, we know God's love, fellowship with him, and the power of his name. Jesus' purpose is broader than that, however. He calls us to communicate this unity to the world. He wants us to share with all men and women the good news that the intimate, loving relationship that he enjoys with the Father is possible for them, too. When we are united, the presence of Jesus-all the power of his name and the love of God will be found in us.
{paragraph}This is the mission of the church, to share the gospel with all people. The Lord God, who is one, is himself the life that Jesus wants all men and women to have. As those called to bring that message to others, we must reflect the life and the unity that come from God alone.
{paragraph}Such unity, however, cannot be counterfeited by even our best efforts. The only way to achieve it is to look to Jesus' life and follow the way he established for us. The unity he had with the Father radiated throughout his life in his obedience to and reliance on God. To experience this kind of unity, we must open our hearts to Jesus and receive the blessings of unity, which is God's love for others manifested in lives transformed by the Spirit. Let us examine our relationships and repent for the ways we allow, and even encourage, disunity in our families, communities, parishes, and places of work. Let us ask the Holy Spirit to show us where we are intolerant of others because of their race, religion, economic status, or even their appearance, dress or way of speaking. As we ask forgiveness, God himself will build up his church through our witness; his work will be furthered by our unity.
