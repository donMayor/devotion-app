<title>Be Faithful</title>

<message>
God looks for faithful men and women to carry 
out His purpose and work here on earth. The 
Bible gives us Daniel as one who was faithful to God 
in  a  most  remarkable  and  inspiring  way.  Daniel  6:4 
says, �Then the presidents and princes sought to find 
occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but 
they  could  find  none  occasion  nor  fault; forasmuch 
as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault 
found in him.� 
Daniel was impeccably faithful and devoted to the 
Lord;  the  Scripture  says  there  was  neither  any  error 
nor  fault  found  in  him.  He  was  neither  corrupt  nor 
negligent. He was faithful in all his dealings. He served 
God with purpose and uprightness, in truth and with 
unmistakable  commitment.  His  faithfulness  was  with 
direction�very definitive. He was clear about who he 
was faithful to, and what his faithfulness was about. He 
remained faithful to God even when he was persecuted 
by his government in things pertaining to God. This is 
one of the principles of a faithful man. 
As  believers,  our  primary  allegiance,  dedication, 
commitment and loyalty is first to God and His Word 
Be Faithful
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ 
which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and 
peace, from God our Father and the Lord 
Jesus Christ (Colossians 1:2).
tuesday ,  january 1 stPrayer
Dear Father, I thank you for dispensing 
abundant grace and blessings into my 
life,  and  I  declare  my  absolute  trust 
and  allegiance  to  you,  as  I  faithfully 
serve you with my life, in Jesus� Name. 
Amen.
before  anything  else.  Persecution  may  come  at  you 
from  all  angles,  but  you  must  remain  steadfast  and 
undaunted in your service and allegiance to the Lord. 
You must object to doing anything that isn�t consistent 
with  the Word  of  God. Yes,  Daniel  was  thrown  into 
the lion�s den because he chose to be faithful to God, 
but God shut the mouths of the lions. 
1  Corinthians  4:2  says �Moreover  it  is  required 
in  stewards,  that  a  man  be  found  faithful.�  Faithful 
people are those chosen for important responsibilities, 
therefore,  learn,  and  choose  to  be  a  faithful  steward. 
In  your  service  in  God�s  house,  in  using  the  gifts  and 
abilities God has given you, in the financial and material 
blessings  you  receive  from  God,  and  in  evangelizing 
your world, choose to be faithful!

<title>The Compassion of jesus
</title>

<memorize>
And Jesus, when he came out, saw much 
people, and was moved with compassion 
toward them, because they were as sheep not 
having a shepherd: and he began to teach 
them many things 
</memorize>

<verse>
Mark 6:34
</verse>


<message>
Compassion  is  a  great  feeling  of  favourable
emotion  towards  others,  often  backed  with 
the  desire  and  willingness  to  help.  As  Christians, 
God  has  given  us  His  nature. We  have  His  nature  of 
compassion, love, forgiveness, and mercy. All of these 
work together. The Lord Jesus was the perfect example 
of  a  compassionate  person.  He  was  so  considerate, 
loving and kind to everyone He met. 
On  a  certain  occasion,  the  Bible  tells  us  that  the 
Lord  Jesus  was  moved  with  compassion  towards  the 
multitudes  and  told  His  disciples  that  they  should 
pray  to  the  Lord  of  the  harvest  to  send  in  labourers 
to  the  field  (Matthew  9:36-38). You're  part  of  these
labourers. You'll however not be an effective labourer
unless you have the compassion of Jesus. If you're full
of compassion, you'll be spurred to action irrespective
of  daunting  circumstances;  you'll  be  quick  to  help
and  bless  others. You  need  compassion  to  overlook 
criticisms and the wrongs done to you by others. 
On  yet  another  occasion,  a  leper  came  to  Jesus, 
and the Master didn�t turn him away. Instead, the Lord Prayer
Dear Father, I bless your holy Name and 
thank you for filling my heart with your 
love and kindness. Thank you for your 
Spirit that lives within me, helping me to 
be sensitive to the needs of others, and 
to touch them with your love, mercy and 
compassion, in Jesus� Name. Amen.
was moved with compassion, and stretching forth His 
hand, He touched the leper and said ��be thou clean� 
(Mark  1:41).  Immediately,  the  leprosy  departed  and 
the  man  was  made  whole  (Mark  1:42);  the  power  of 
compassion! </message>

<title>Safeguarded by the Anointing
</title>

<memorize>
Little children, it is the last time: and as ye 
have heard that antichrist shall come, even 
now are there many antichrists; whereby we 
know that it is the last time�.But ye have an 
unction from the Holy One, and ye know all 
things
</memorize> 
<verse>
1 John 2:18-20
</verse> 

<message>
T he Scripture reveals that in the last days there�ll 
be many antichrists; many who�ll come in their 
own names with false doctrines. A false doctrine isn�t 
necessarily the opposite of the Gospel; it�s a perversion 
of truth. It may sound very close to the Gospel, but it�s 
not  the  Gospel.  Its  aim  is  to  deceive  and  lure  people 
away from the true Gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
As  a  child  of  God,  however,  you  don�t  have  to 
fret  over  how  many  antichrists,  false  preachers,  and 
false teachers there are out there. This is because your 
heart and mind are anointed to know the truth. By the 
anointing  of  the  Holy  Spirit  that�s  on  your  life,  you�re 
able to tell right from wrong, and to discern the right 
teaching of the Gospel from false doctrines. 
1  John  2:27  tells  us, �But  the  anointing  which  ye 
have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not 
that  any  man  teach  you:  but  as  the  same  anointing 
teacheth  you  of  all  things,  and  is  truth,  and  is  no  lie, 
and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.� 
The  Holy  Spirit  is  the  Lord  of  the  Church,  and  when 
Safeguarded By The Anointing
Little children, it is the last time: and as ye
have heard that antichrist shall come, even 
now are there many antichrists; whereby we 
know that it is the last time�.But ye have an 
unction from the Holy One, and ye know all 
things (1 John 2:18-20).  you hear the Word of God, under the anointing of the 
Holy  Spirit,  the  same  Spirit  in  you  will  bear  witness 
with your spirit that what you�re hearing is the truth. 
That�s why you can�t be deceived or swayed from the 
truth  that  you�ve  come  to  believe,  because  there�s 
a  special  ability  from  the  Holy  Spirit  that  makes  you 
know the truth. 
If  you�d  yield  to  the  guidance  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 
you won�t find yourself being deceived by the evil one, 
neither  will  you  make  the  wrong  choices,  decisions 
and investments in life. That anointing is activated by 
the  recognition  and  acknowledgment  of  His Word  in 
your life</message>

<title>Put the Name to work
</title>

<memorize>
These things have I written unto you that 
believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye 
may know that ye have eternal life, and that 
ye may believe on the name of the Son of God 
</memorize>

<verse>
1 John 5:13
</verse>

<message>
Notice  the  underlined  construction.  The
Apostle John says, ��that ye may know that 
ye  have  eternal  life,  and  that  ye  may  believe  on  the 
name  of  the  Son  of  God.�  He�s  simply  saying, �Put 
the Name of Jesus to work!� 
The Name of Jesus is the Name that opens every 
door  in  every  city  and  every  nation. That�s  the  Name 
you  need  for  a  life  of  consistent  victory,  anywhere. 
For example, when Jesus gave the great commission 
in  Mark  16:15  to ��Go  ye  into  all  the  world,  and 
preach  the  gospel  to  every  creature,�  it  was  in  His 
Name.  He  gave  us  His  Name,  and  that�s  bigger  than 
the whole world. Philippians 2:10 says ��at the name 
of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, 
and things in earth, and things under the earth.� This 
is the reason you can be comfortable in any place, any 
city,  region  or  nation. You�re  on  a  divine  assignment, 
sent forth, not in your own name, but in that matchless 
Name of Jesus.
Luke�s report in Acts 3 about Peter and John is a 
detailed example of men who dared to use the Name 
of Jesus. Incidentally, this was their first miracle after 
Jesus�  ascension. When  Peter  met  the  crippled  man Prayer
Dear Father, I thank you for the power 
in the Name of Jesus, and the authority 
I  have  to  use  that  Name  against  the 
devil, sickness, disease and everything 
that  hurts  or  binds.  By  the  power  of 
that Name, I declare that I�m living the 
higher life of glory that you prearranged 
for me, in Jesus� Name. Amen. 
at  the  gate  of  the  temple  called  Beautiful,  he  said  to 
him ��such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus 
Christ  of  Nazareth  rise  up  and  walk�  (Acts  3:6). The 
man  couldn�t  walk  in  his  own  name  or  in  his  father�s 
name. Niether was he able to walk in Herod�s, Pilate�s 
or  Caesar�s  name;  but  he  did  in  the  Name  of  Jesus! 
Acts  3:7-8  says  Peter ��took  him  by  the  right  hand, 
and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle 
bones  received  strength.  And  he  leaping  up  stood, 
and walked�.�
The  reason  for  the  failure,  defeat,  sickness  and 
weakness in the lives of many people is failure to trust 
and use the Name of Jesus in the crises of life. Psalm 
20:7  AMP  says �Some  trust  in  and  boast  of  chariots 
and some of horses, but we will trust in and boast of 
the name of the Lord our God.�  Put the Name of Jesus 
to work in every area of your life. The Word says to do 
all things in the Name of Jesus (Colossians 3:17).

<title>Be the Best for Him

 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and
wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works;
and that my soul knoweth right well

<message>
T he verse above describes the peculiarity and 
uniqueness  of  every  child  of  God.  You�re 
the  Father�s  pride;  a  creation  of  wonder.  God  has 
deposited so much within your spirit that makes you 
a peculiar treasure of inestimable value. 
In  Genesis  chapter  12:2  God  said  to  Abraham, 
�And  I  will  make  of  thee  a  great  nation,  and  I  will 
bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt 
be  a  blessing.�  You�re  the  seed  of  Abraham  now 
that  you�re  in  Christ: �...if  ye  be  Christ�s,  then  are  ye 
Abraham�s  seed�  (Galatians  3:29).  By  virtue  of  being 
Abraham�s seed, not only are you blessed, you�re also 
a blessing. You carry the blessing with you and have 
become a dispenser of blessings everywhere you go. 
No wonder 1 Peter 2:9 declares: �But ye are a chosen 
generation,  a  royal  priesthood,  an  holy  nation,  a 
peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises 
of  him  who  hath  called  you  out  of  darkness  into  his 
marvellous light.� 
Take some time today and meditate on who you 
are  in  Christ  Jesus! You�re  God�s  perfectly  crafted 
masterpiece, set forth to manifest His glory and display His praises to the world around you. Your responsibility 
now is to be the best of you for Him. 
You�re  the  only  one  of  you  that  God  has.  He�s 
never  had  another  one  like  you,  He  doesn�t  have 
another like you, and will never have another like you. 
That�s  how  unique  you  are. Therefore  be  a  success 
for  Him!  Be  the  best  of  you  for  Him,  and  give  Him 
your all.

Behold, what manner of love the Father hath

sunday ,  january 6 th
G od didn�t create you to be a failure but to be 
head  over  all  things.  He  wants  you  to  walk 
in the liberty and full assurance of His love, knowing 
that you�re beyond condemnation due to His infallible, 
unconditional  and  eternal  love  for  you  (Romans  8:1). 
He loves you just the way you are. 
You  didn�t  have  to  struggle  to  earn  God�s  love, 
for you could never earn it by your own works but by 
grace; it�s a gift from God! All you have to do is accept 
His  love  as  simply  as  it  has  come  to  you,  and  you�ll 
never remain the same again. God demonstrated His 
great  and  boundless  love  for  us,  while  we  were  yet 
in  sin.  Perhaps  you�re  wondering, �Can  God  possibly 
love  someone  like  me?�  Emphatically  yes!  No  matter 
what kind of life you may have lived, He loves you just 
the way you are; you can take advantage of His great 
love today.
The consciousness of God�s love will change you 
for  the  better  and  inspire  you  to  love  other  people. 
His  love  gives  you  the  ability  to  live  in  the  liberty  of 
His Word and enjoy His abundant life. God�s love will 
carry you over all the circumstances of life. Jesus said Prayer
Heavenly Father, I thank you for your 
great love and kindness towards me! In 
everything I do today, and everywhere 
I  go,  I�m  mindful  of  your  love,  and 
that  consciousness  inspires  faith  and 
boldness in me to face the circumstances 
of life and win! I rejoice in your loving 
kindness,  which  has  strengthened  my 
hope  in  you.  Therefore  are  my  days 
full of rest and peace, in Jesus� Name. 
Amen.    
John 16:26-27; romans 8:31-32
He doesn�t have to pray to the Father on your behalf, 
since  the  Father  Himself  loves  you  (John  16:26). Take 
advantage of His great love today. 
Remember, Jesus didn�t come to save us because 
we were many; no! He did because of His love. You�re 
the object of His love. Be conscious of this truth today; 
God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
